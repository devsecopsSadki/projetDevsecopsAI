    "purpose": "To establish standards for identifying and remediating source code vulnerabilities through static analysis.",
    "description": "This policy defines requirements for SAST implementation, vulnerability management, and secure code development practices.",
    "applicability": "All development teams and applications with custom source code.",
    "enforcement": "Mandatory SAST scans in CI/CD pipeline with quality gates that block promotion of code containing findings above the defined severity threshold.",
    "exceptions": "Legacy applications may request temporary exemptions through the Security Review Board, provided a risk‑based justification and compensating controls are documented."

  "executive_summary": "The current code base exhibits critical and high‑severity vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized data access and system compromise. Immediate remediation of hard‑coded credentials and SQL injection flaws, combined with a continuous SAST program, will substantially reduce the organization’s attack surface.",
  "scope": "Application source code security analysis for all in‑house and third‑party developed applications.",
  "objectives": [
    "Integrate automated SAST tooling into every build pipeline.",
    "Ensure timely remediation of findings based on severity and business impact.",
    "Maintain a measurable reduction in code‑level risk over time."
