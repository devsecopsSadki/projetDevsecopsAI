    "purpose": "To establish standards for identifying and remediating source code vulnerabilities through static analysis.",
    "description": "This policy defines requirements for SAST implementation, vulnerability management, and secure code development practices.",
    "applicability": "All development teams and applications with custom source code.",
    "enforcement": "Mandatory SAST scans in CI/CD pipeline with quality gates.",

  "executive_summary": "The current code base contains a critical hard‑coded credential and a high‑severity SQL injection risk, indicating an immediate need for stronger secure‑coding controls. By embedding automated SAST into the CI/CD pipeline and enforcing remediation timelines, the organization will reduce exploitation likelihood and protect sensitive data.",
  "scope": "Application source code security analysis for all internally developed and third‑party integrated software components.",
  "objectives": [
    "Integrate automated SAST tools into every build pipeline and enforce pass/fail gates.",
    "Ensure timely remediation of identified vulnerabilities based on risk ranking.",
    "Establish continuous monitoring and reporting to maintain compliance with NIST CSF and ISO 27001."
