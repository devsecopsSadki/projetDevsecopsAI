Total des vulnérabilités trouvées: 3

--- DAST Finding #1 ---
Vulnerability: Insufficient Site Isolation Against Spectre Vulnerability
Severity: Low (Medium)
Confidence: 2
Target (URL/Endpoint): http://app-container:8080/actuator/health
Description: <p>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header is an opt-in header designed to counter side-channels attacks like Spectre. Resource should be specifically set as shareable amongst different origins.</p>
Recommendation: <p>Ensure that the application/web server sets the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header appropriately, and that it sets the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header to 'same-origin' for all web pages.</p><p>'same-site' is considered as less secured and should be avoided.</p><p>If resources must be shared, set the header to 'cross-origin'.</p><p>If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that supports the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header (https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cross-origin-resource-policy).</p>
CWE ID: 693
WASC ID: 14

--- DAST Finding #2 ---
Vulnerability: X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
Severity: Low (Medium)
Confidence: 2
Target (URL/Endpoint): http://app-container:8080/actuator/health
Description: <p>The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.</p>
Recommendation: <p>Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.</p><p>If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.</p>
CWE ID: 693
WASC ID: 15

--- DAST Finding #3 ---
Vulnerability: Storable and Cacheable Content
Severity: Informational (Medium)
Confidence: 2
Target (URL/Endpoint): http://app-container:8080/
Description: <p>The response contents are storable by caching components such as proxy servers, and may be retrieved directly from the cache, rather than from the origin server by the caching servers, in response to similar requests from other users. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where "shared" caching servers such as "proxy" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.</p>
Recommendation: <p>Validate that the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information. If it does, consider the use of the following HTTP response headers, to limit, or prevent the content being stored and retrieved from the cache by another user:</p><p>Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private</p><p>Pragma: no-cache</p><p>Expires: 0</p><p>This configuration directs both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 compliant caching servers to not store the response, and to not retrieve the response (without validation) from the cache, in response to a similar request.</p>
CWE ID: 524
