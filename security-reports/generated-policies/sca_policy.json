    "purpose": "To manage third‑party dependency security risks and ensure supply‑chain integrity for all software assets.",
    "description": "This policy establishes mandatory requirements for automated dependency scanning, vulnerability triage, remediation, and the creation and maintenance of a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).",
    "applicability": "All applications, services, containers, and infrastructure‑as‑code artifacts that incorporate third‑party libraries, packages, or open‑source components.",
    "enforcement": "Automated SCA scans must run on every code commit and build pipeline; builds containing high‑severity (CVSS ≥7.0) vulnerable dependencies are blocked until remediation or approved exception.",
    "exceptions": "Critical business‑critical dependencies with no viable alternatives may be approved by the Change Advisory Board (CAB) provided compensating controls such as runtime monitoring and additional penetration testing are implemented."

  "executive_summary": "Our current software supply chain contains 33 known vulnerable dependencies, including 16 high‑severity findings. Immediate remediation and continuous monitoring are required to reduce exposure and comply with regulatory and contractual obligations.",
  "scope": "Third‑party dependency and supply‑chain security for all development, test, and production environments.",
  "objectives": [
    "Establish a definitive, version‑controlled inventory of all third‑party components.",
    "Detect and remediate high‑severity vulnerabilities within 7 days of discovery.",
    "Maintain an up‑to‑date SBOM and ensure continuous compliance with licensing and security policies."
