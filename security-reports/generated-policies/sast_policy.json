    "purpose": "To establish standards for identifying and remediating source code vulnerabilities through static analysis.",
    "description": "This policy defines requirements for SAST implementation, vulnerability management, and secure code development practices across the organization.",
    "applicability": "All development teams and applications that contain custom source code, including micro‑services, libraries, and scripts.",
    "enforcement": "Mandatory SAST scans must be integrated into every CI/CD pipeline with defined quality gates; builds failing the gate are blocked from promotion.",
    "exceptions": "Legacy applications may request temporary exemptions through the Security Review Board, subject to a documented risk acceptance and remediation timeline."

  "policy_type": "SAST",
  "executive_summary": "The organization adopts a risk‑based SAST program aligned with NIST CSF and ISO 27001 to continuously detect code‑level weaknesses. Current findings are limited to a single low‑severity issue, indicating an overall healthy code security posture while highlighting the need for ongoing review of unknown findings.",
  "scope": "Application source code security analysis for all in‑house developed software components.",
  "objectives": [
    "Integrate automated static analysis into every code commit and build process.",
    "Ensure identified vulnerabilities are triaged, prioritized, and remediated within defined timeframes.",
    "Maintain compliance with NIST CSF Protect function and ISO 27001 A.14 System Development lifecycle controls."
