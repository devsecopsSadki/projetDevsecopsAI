    "purpose": "To identify and remediate runtime security vulnerabilities through dynamic testing",
    "description": "This policy defines requirements for DAST implementation, runtime security monitoring, and production security hardening",
    "applicability": "All web applications, APIs, and internet‑facing services",
    "enforcement": "Pre‑production DAST scans required before deployment to production",

  "executive_summary": "Current runtime scanning has uncovered three medium‑severity findings that expose the organization to data leakage, content spoofing, and speculative execution attacks. Immediate remediation and hardened scanning processes are required to reduce the attack surface and align with NIST CSF and ISO 27001 controls.",
